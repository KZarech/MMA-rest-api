I created a table for weight classes of fighters for easier management, dynamic classes and for possibility to add more info for class in the future.


I was thinking about separating the fighters personal info and their stats (weight, wins, etc) into different tables,
but decided not to do so due to the lack of time (in real project I would separate them so it will be easier to add new stats and some info for each fighter).


I created a separated table for locations to make the project more dynamic so in future it will be possible to:
  display all events for some specific location;
  add some info about location;
  create countries table, add column country into locations and show all events in each country;
  make some tournaments with multiple locations, countries;
  etc.  

Didn’t have time to handle locations, weight classes deletion 
(they are used in another tables so simple deletion won’t do the job - some handlers should be done, but I really didn’t have time to do that properly)
